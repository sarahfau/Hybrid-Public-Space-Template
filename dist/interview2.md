# Preserving fossils for predicting future forms with Olia Lialina

SF&emsp;&emsp;*Now, does your current use of the tags make it possible to use them now, as well as in the future? And are you going to make their access more open?*

OL&emsp;&emsp;Yes, besides ensuring that all this material is not lost, I am also doing it with the idea to make my research usable in the future, for the next person who will look at it, but a certain effort would have to be made as a certain point that it also functions without me. Now, the tags I give create a cryptic language, only I can understand them. For example #tyt and #exodus : when web pages promise to make a web page, I write #tyt, which is the abbreviation for ‘take your time’. The tag #exodus is when somebody says that he stopped making his webpage, and there are a lot of pages like that. I am the only one who can use it without comments at this moment. When I give workshops, I have to give explanations. Some things can be seen as an opposite : there is a tag called #torture. One would think that the script is a torture to see, but what I mean is that it’s torture no to see how it was initially supposed to be, in most cases animated. In that case, somebody who doesn’t know my intentions would think the opposite. So this immediately means that if there is an option to open it for more people, there must be a lot of adjustments that need to be made, or comments. It is explainable but it is not self explanatory yet. But yes, this process would be even more interesting if it could be other people who could act on this.

SF&emsp;&emsp;*Do you think that from looking at the past, the web 1.0, and analysing how it was, will have a certain power of action for the future? Do you think that this analysis of how it was can influence the future, of how it will be?*

OL&emsp;&emsp;It is important to ensure that archives don’t vanish. This is the reason why I so often say that people should look at everything with their own eyes. I don’t think that somebody else would go from the beginning till the end, ever, so I imagine that if somebody is interested, this person would maybe be interested in something particular. And I hope that, through this tagging system, I can attract the attention on these specificities. If somebody is interested in animé, he will have anime, sailormoon, pokemon, dragonballs, he can go there and look at such things. But going further with the tag #flash, I tag everything that is made with Flash, thinking that it can also be an interesting keyword. And sometimes, especially when Flash will definitely stop to exist, there can be researchers that could be interested.
What could be a very important example that was killed by Yahoo is Del.icio.us, a categorisation system. It was unfortunately bought by Yahoo, and definitely shut down in 2017. It doesn’t exist anymore. And this I would say is a real crime. Sometimes like this could have been developed, because it was personal but at the same time meaningful and controlled. From the user's side, you could make your own decisions, arrange things, and at the same time it was semantic, so it was really a meaningful way to collaborate, and share. Of course, Yahoo didn’t want it to exist and to invest into it. They just closed it because they didn’t see the value of it. It was a very mature and promising system that was between the amateur pages and the rating systems of Google for example, and these completely hidden algorithms.
