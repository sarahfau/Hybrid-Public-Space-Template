# Living material vs. semantic bits, with Pierre Mohamed-Petit from NOOR Images

SF&emsp;&emsp;*Specifically in the context of photojournalism, the tagging process acts as the first interpretive layer on a photograph. Many different interpretations can be attributed to one single photograph. When you tag an image, are all the tags related to a certain reading of the image, or are you defining tags that allow a reading of the image in all kinds of different ways?*

PMP&emsp;&emsp;We always ask for general keywords to give you an idea of the story, so the concept, what it is about. Then afterwards we ask the photographer to individually go through each image and give more details: this is a portrait, this is a woman, this is a sexual violence survivor, this is chaos. It is not only defining what we see, but also the context. For some series, the keywords are all the same. But some stories will require a specific labelling process. There can be several axes within the same series. For instance, I’m not gonna tag violence against women if there’s not a woman in the front, or family if you just see a house on one of the images of the series. Suppose I’m looking for a story about Israel, Palestine, I type Israel and Palestine, and I’ll find images that are part of that story. If I want a Palestinian woman, I’m gonna type woman palestine and I’m gonna be able to make my search a bit more accurate and not show the whole story. There are always specific captions related to what you see and what the story is about, and then there will be broader ones. Some are related but not much, it’s as far as you can get. Sometimes I’m gonna find words that seem to have nothing to do with the image, but they are part of this big family. If I’m talking about sexual violence, I’m also gonna talk about trauma, weapons, war crime, so I can define it.

SF&emsp;&emsp;*The tagging system quickly established itself as an appropriate and reliable tool to classify digital content. But what is implicated by this translation from stories, feelings into bits of data?*

PMP&emsp;&emsp;I believe that archive is information. And information is not only about defining what we see. Through such tools as a tagging system, the creativity, the feeling, and the emotion can be translated into data. Because that’s how our world is turning. It’s developing towards a very calculated space where it’s about algorithms, not about the space, or the context. This is why you find a lot of people who are miss-using images. Many people look at images and depend on them, but they are not visually literate. As a photographer, I get the meaning of a photograph, I see things. If I show the same photographer to my mother, she will see something radically different. She is a teacher, she doesn’t know anything about tags or data but still she uses images every day of her life. We know that tags are transforming the way photographs are perceived. I find it interesting to see how people who are outside the industry have completely different points than ours.
