# 06 Indexes 2.0: physical molds vs. digital templates with Pierke I.S. Bosschieter, Caroline Diepeveen

SF&emsp;&emsp;*In 2011, you received a price for your collaboration on the index for The Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World by Norman Stillman, which covers the jews of muslim lands particularly in the late medieval, early modern and modern periods. I imagine that working with such a complex content required defining multiple parameters to elaborate a proper index. It raised diverse issues but in particular the question of how an index is presented once created and established.*

*On the online version of the encyclopedia the index becomes the only way to enter the content, turning each keyword clickable. Secondly, the structure is divided into several layers: the letters of the alphabet as a dropdown menu which contains the keywords associated with the category. In your opinion, what difference does it make in the apprehension of an online index or a back-of-the-book index, in the way it is visually presented?*


CD&emsp;&emsp;It should be appropriate for the kind of publication it belongs to but visual presentation of the index is important. Sometimes, like with these large Brill publications, there are reference works that are online, so they are not really in a book format online, and people can search within the index, so you don’t see the complete index in front of you, like you see with a book. You have to type in a term, and then you might see what is around it, the context, if it’s done well. And then it will point you to the article in the Encyclopedia, when you find an index term, and you can just click on it and it takes you to the article that you want to see. So in that, it is visually different from a text index. But what we most often do is these back-of-the-book indexes or ebook indexes. I have to credit the publisher of the Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World, Brill, that they did a very good job with the online index. If we look at one page of the back-of the-book index for the same publication, it is very traditional in presentation. As you can see they really adapted the index to the online environment very well. But then Brill is a publisher that is very experienced in publishing online reference works.


SF&emsp;&emsp;*You introduced the notion of context. An index brings together words into a coherent whole, and each keyword can itself be found in its original context, surrounded by other sentences which assign more meaning to it. This is where the main difference lies with tags. There is rarely a global visualisation of all the tags in the same database. It introduces the notion of quantity and volume. How central is the notion of quantity in the effectiveness of an index?*

CD&emsp;&emsp;I would say that quantity is not an extremely important aspect of indexes, but it is certainly a matter meriting consideration. What is important is that the size of the index is appropriate for the publication it belongs to. For an academic level text the index density has to be higher than for a text that is meant for a general readership. A sort of rule of thumb is that academic texts could have a density of about ten indexed terms per page, whereas for texts for a general readership it is more likely to be three terms per page. The publication of the encyclopedia is made up of 5 volumes, and nearly all of it is the index, so the index is almost a complete book. The index starts p.141 and it continues to p.499. It is one of the largest indexes we ever did. This also means that when you have a cumulative index of a publication consisting of five volumes, the index is going to be much larger, than when you have an index for a 200 page book.


SF&emsp;&emsp;*Within an index, are the keywords always organised according to the alphabetical order? If so, as much as the selection of specific words influences how we enter into the content, do you think that the way of ordering and presenting the keywords also influences how we apprehend and interpret the information?*


CD&emsp;&emsp;It is funny you’re saying this, because I’ve just been to an exhibition at Witte de With in Rotterdam about Alejandro Cesarco, which I was quite fascinated by. It consists of an ongoing series of indexes conceived by the artist itself, for imaginary books. Since 2000, it was the first time that all the indexes were exhibited together. And there, because you see the elements in a specific order, you start thinking of the impact of the structure. You will be influenced by the first term you see in the index. So sometimes I give my first entry a lot of thoughts, even if I think that it is a bit silly to do that. An index, and especially a back-of-the-book index, where you have a view of it, does influence you in the way you look at the book. I know many people saying that they look at the index first, before they decide to buy the book. If it is a good index it should give you a proper impression of what’s in the book. You probably get even more influenced by it if you are visually focused, and I guess that design is more into how things look. The work of Alejandro Cesarco is strongly influenced by literary theory and in the cross-over between text and visual.
