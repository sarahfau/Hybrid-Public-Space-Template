# 03 Human monitoring, with Pierre Mohamed-Petit from NOOR Images

SF&emsp;&emsp;*In the act of tagging, I imagine that photojournalism agencies have a strong responsibility in how images are interpreted. It is not just a neutral description. Therefore, does this specific task the responsibility of only one person, or is it a collaborative process?*

PMP&emsp;&emsp;For every photograph, we ask the photographer to fill in a caption and a series of keywords, following a guideline we established. It acts like a protocol to guide the photographer in how to label and tag his images.
Extract of the protocol guideline:

*Caption: The caption should not be too long and must include all relevant information which cannot be viewed in the picture.*

*Keywords: Keywords are an essential tool for image search. Please use keywords which are related to the image and story.*

PMP&emsp;&emsp;It is important to mention that it is the photographer's responsibility to fill in the keywords. Especially in the context of photojournalism, the caption literally needs to be filled in by the one who is taking the image, because this person will understand the context, and what’s going on in the image. I cannot process this information. If there’s no caption to a story, I reject it. And if we do not agree on something we have a discussion, but they still have the authority to decide. The photographers are aware of the ethics of NOOR and how to approach things, but they are also activists themselves, they do stand for values, and that’s where the tags sometimes reflect that, how they felt. Feeling scared, feeling trauma. They are visual researchers to also be themselves speakers.

SF&emsp;&emsp;*I believe that a human-based system appears as a really valuable way to ensure a good reading of an item, and therefore a right destination and utilisation. Would you agree to say that the human eye subjectivity is a means of controlling the scope of each image?*

PMP&emsp;&emsp;The act of putting words on things is really important. I do think that it needs to be done by a human, but at the same time, who is that human, because tags have an influential way of changing the meaning of the story. When someone forged an image, it has consequences, even more with sensitive stories. This is also why I am acting as a filter, between the photographers and the output. There’s a two filter system. It’s verification. How do you verify it? Recently I was working on an archive story by Tanya Habjouqa who shoots a lot in the West Bank in Israel. It is a story about the Israeli army and settlers bombing people’s places so they leave. When we were looking at the story, we had this whole debate about the term land-grabbing she added and what was its definition. So it is land-grabbing, but it isn’t land-grabbing. We are reporting on factual issues, so it is extremely important to use the right word, because you can phrase an opinion, a feeling, or something very subjective in a writing, but you cannot tag and define something as land-grabbing when it isn’t. It’s our responsibility to tag properly, and this is why we use a human filter to do so: tagging is the human input to the image. Because also we believe technology is not there yet in a way. If you mistag, but also if you don’t tag something, you will end up not accurately representing what you’re showing, or misrupt people, places, events, time and it can create a misunderstanding of a situation. Contextualising is needed when it has a public scope. That’s the importance of keeping information correct, it’s a duty that people have. This is why I believe what I’m doing. The archive, the importance of the information, what you are putting in needs to be accurate. And everything always comes back to the first protocol. Once the protocol is followed, for one image, whatever I do and wherever it goes, it will always tell the same story. The information will always be there.
