# 05 Resisting alive systems with Olia Lialina

SF&emsp;&emsp;*Your project One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age is centered around the preservation and restoration of websites from the web hosting service GeoCities.com, which was shut down in 2009. I can imagine that this meticulous work requires a methodical and rigorous approach leading to elaborate an efficient system for sorting and classifying the content found. How does your work relate to the use of classification and the tagging process?*

OL&emsp;&emsp;When the server Geocities shut down, only 1 Terabyte bit-torrent file could be rescued, and it required first to make that data accessible again to start organising it. Today, we have different platforms. One is the Tumblr, as one way to access the archive, in chronological order. It started on the 7th of february 2013, with the page that was last updated in September 1995. Every 20 minutes, there is a new screenshot of a web page. Now I am in october 2003. The tags on the Tumblr are automatically assigned. GeoCities pages were initially sorted into categories using the scheme *GeoCities.com/neighborhood/number*. Each web page represented a digital house in a certain subhood, itself part of a neighbourhood, based on the subject of your homepage. So the tags relate to 4 types of information: the neighbourhood it came from, or if it was a vanity profile, the last update date, on which browser, and the resolution of the screenshot.
But I also give a series of tags myself, that are important for analysing the materials. There are two types: either about content or about structure. For content tags for example the #bsb tag relates to pages about Backstreet boys. You will also find a #britney tag for Britney Spears and all other names, meaning that the pages made are mostly fan pages, or pages about these celebrities. It can also exist more general tags like #wedding, if it is a web page made for somebody's wedding, or an announcement of the wedding. Then the second type of tags would be more from a technical perspective, about the structure. The tags for navigation for example, if I think it is especially well made, that something in relation to navigation attracted my attention.

SF&emsp;&emsp;*Now that the web has diversified, the conditions and parameters of being online have changed. How the evolution and development of the web from the web 1.0 to now has influenced what is visible or invisible, accessible or inaccessible? How has this shift led to the vanishing of amateur web pages? Is there still room for such pages?*

OL&emsp;&emsp;The amateur web became almost invisible. It did not disappear but it is now hidden. Web 1.0 pages were killed, laughed about, pushed away from the attention, especially because they were not well categorised, they were not semantic. It was the pleasure and the beauty of it, but that’s also why it has been considered as unnecessary and was not promoted. They were resisting the classification methods that could be profitable for services and content providers. Because if you look at the HTML code of these pages, what I looked in, an algorithm can’t just say this is a person, this is a female, 35 years old, and that she lives in Los Angeles. It is not adapted to be read and understood by an algorithm. And all these collections were made by people themselves. They were providing their own external links from their web page. It could be a link to a website that gave you weather forecasts but also links to search engines, which I think was a very powerful moment in history. You spend a lot of time, you take initiatives, you categorise things, but so that it can be appreciated by another human and creating your own connections : I am a portal, I am providing links to people to search engines. 

SF&emsp;&emsp;*This shift in digital cultures has contributed in rendering the underlying systems as invisible as possible, assigning them to another function. In the context of obsolete or abandoned internet platforms, do you think that a tool such as the tagging process can act as an anchor to keep track of them? How do you think that these underlying structural tools play a role in the access to information?*

OL&emsp;&emsp;The act of tagging is very influential, and people who make this tagging, or people who write algorithms to make it, have a lot of power. It is a lot of hidden data, so it is really important to categorise, to tag, or to try to find subcategories and to make connections. I see tags as a way to describe. And in the end, it probably very much influences the result, of how we see something, the visual culture. It gets directly more fascinating if you look at how things are arranged in social networks and platforms : the chronological order is moved to the back. Every thing you would be able to arrange yourself alphabetically or chronologically is absolutely on purpose replaced with something else, either with popularity or with ideas of what you could want or not want. And all this sounds like a good service to you, but I think it is something very dangerous because chronological and alphabetical order are tools that you can have control of. It is a way to have something already readable, that is neutral and not influenced by some algorithms. It acts like something you can rely on, like gravity. You know it is universal, how the time is counted and this is the same for the alphabetical order, there is an universal agreement. What is happening now is that you are getting more and more lost in very determined categories, in which you can’t make your own categories out of it. There are some authoritarian systems, some tagging systems, so the content is organised in a way that it moves to the next level : it’s not chronological, not alphabetical, it is not simple anymore. And now, from what I absorb and how things are developed in all the sorting systems, I have the impression that it is a plan to remove chronological order from everything.
