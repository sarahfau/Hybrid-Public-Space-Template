# Interview22


**Juan Gomez:** We spoke a lot last time about temporality and it’s the influence on participatory decision making in public space.

I’m already quite advanced of my thesis that you read and have some questions that I think you could answer accurately as you have the director of a master (Master on ephemeral architecture and temporary spaces in Elisava (Barcelona) but also have a practice as an urbanist.

There are two aspects we talked:
One was festivity as a way to create a sense of belonging to a place, and the other was the short time span that a “pop up” installation in relation to the use it has.

Something temporary but that in the long term has a more significant trajectory. How can short time create long-term impact? How can the short term be created as sustainability?
I would like your point of view on this.

**Roger Paez:** It seems to me a key issue in many ways and what you are talking about this can be raised from many points of view.

The question of temporality in space in the spatial project what I understand as architecture at all levels that goes well beyond conventional architecture seems to have an interest at multiple levels. The first is a question that we could call order epoch, which is the pre-eminence (at least in the first world). The pre-eminence of experience with respect to structure, the pre-eminence at the psychological level even, with regard to material belonging, there is more and more monetized economy that promises and that caters to the experience and not the object or the classic condition of material property assimilated to an object. A house, a car, more conventional status elements.

More and more the value is put in questions of experiential order. It can be seen very clearly in the economic importance of the world of tourism and in the type of trips that are considered beyond the mass tourism. Also that more and more products that are sold or are intended to be sold from the point of view of something that generates an experience, in this sense Coca-Cola was advanced in its time. There is a general sensibility of this epoch that makes that what was understood as “lacking” now valid. As opposed to say what is permanent in the classical model. That which is the structure that remains and therefore that articulates a civilization. The understanding of the temporal as that which is not permanent and therefore has no foundational value, 

On the contrary, it becomes more and more a kind of redoubt of experience and “lived life” as important. This is not only seen in design or architecture. The importance of what has been lived with respect to the conditions that allow you to live it.

This is the first point that makes the reflection on temporality be understood in terms of something minor or something lacking permanence or something that is not yet permanent, can be understood in a positive way. This is an important point of a general framework

Regarding our question is the city. Richard Sennett is very visible now, but he is one of the many who raised the issue that the city is not only the material structure but the organizational social structure. Even classical philosophy had already spoken in these terms. It means that it is not only the question of a material structure (buildings, streets) and other structural systems that allow for the organization of a common public space or private space, but that it is understood that characterizing in a certain way the city is precisely the relationships that are established between the objects and people that inhabit it and therefore the fact that the city is an inhabited environment is a verb. 
Again this preeminence of the verb with respect to the noun(name).

There is this interesting tension in the city between public space in a very clear way, between a fixed physical structure or with a certain degree of permanence, which has to be able to be enormously flexible in assuming uses and appropriations of very diverse order, some programmed and many of them not programmed. That is, generate a structured and therefore permanent environment (a subject, is able to host the verb). This is the crucial question of “inhabiting” and the “inhabitant”( Habitat and Habitar), by this constant they pass from the noun(name) to the verb, the house or that which makes something a house, that the gestures of inhabiting and in the end generate an inhabitant.

I believe that temporality is very important because it allows us to enter into a more immediate, more direct, less heavy horizon at all economic, logistical, legal and other levels, which therefore allows a degree of risk from the point of view design. It is also true they have drawbacks that is that as it is not typified when you go to a town hall with a proposal for a public space intervention they do not know precisely what it is or where they put it and through what administrative logic can be done.

**JG:** What you just said reminds me a bit of the interview I had with the Partizaning collective in Russia, they proposed many things to their municipality and none happened. They told them that they did not see any sense in installing something in the public space since they did not see big economic goals or see any reason for this temporary space to take place and that is why they made their interventions without asking much.

How could a temporary project of this short time exist?
How could there be participation by people in the conception of public space installation?
What factors would give light to a project like this?
Can the concept of community around something, a common goal, or a common idea of ​​a space help?

**RP:**  A quick comment, one of the issues by which one often encounters the difficulty of interlocution with the public administration regarding projects of this type is not so much that it is difficult for them to understand the value because this could be explained well, and it can be shown quite well, but there is a much more pragmatic issue and  that is that it is not typified since the ultra-bureaucratic logic of contemporaneity. Short term is a great advantage because it allows us a risk and an ability to mix skill sets and very different logics of work but at the same time has the difficulty that there is no capitulation on how to do it. For example, there is not a budget for this, then this projects need to be always taken from the budget of artistic interventions or maintenance of public space, but some of these interventions are not easy to classify for the bureaucratic system. The idea of ​​“curating public space,” which had a kind of budgetary entity, would surely allow unlocking many of these issues.

To go to the question, I am very much in agreement with what you say, and I think it is fundamental for what I said at the beginning for the epochal value of temporality and experience, to be able to understand the project positively and affirmatively temporary space. To make this a fundamental issue it is evident that sustainability plays a key role at three levels: economic, social and cultural. The dynamics are not purely playful animation systems as  brand strategist could use, but they are really a kind of “Curatorship of public space.” This is very well understood in the study of landscape, and this discipline interests me a lot because I think it is very close in our logic although it uses different temporalities.

Landscape architecture comes from the world of agronomy and gardening, and they work with long times, but precisely for that reason just as it happens to us with short times the accent of the design is not the result but the process that allows a result to happen. It does not mean that it is not controlled, but it is controlled in a much more “soft” way. In a more conventional architecture, it is much more direct the control of the result if the process serves to arrive at a result that is implemented directly. In ephemeral architecture or landscape architecture, in the first  for short times in the second for long times, time has to be incorporated in a radical way, so what is worked on above all is the design process that will generate results. Not results that you can control fully or want to control with the degree of precision that is managed in permanent architecture.

So in the case of gardening and landscape helps us a lot with this in this logic, for example how to understand that our design gesture today has to be something that is understood as valid today but within 100 years? Also already throughout all these 100 years. When you plant a tree you have to decide what effect this little one will have in the next five years, when the tree is between 10 and 20 and when it is an adult tree between 20 and 50 and when it is a monumental tree. There are very specific logic and techniques of traditional gardening that work in this sense, for example the idea of ​​associating the plantation of an oak with the plantation of a poplar. The poplar grows very fast and the oak very slow. As the poplar grows fast it gives shade to the oak, the oak grows slower but when the oak has grown the poplar can be cut. Management of times

**JG:** It’s like an ecology of gestures.

**RP:**  Exactly

The question of ecology is also crucial because it is the science of relationships; therefore, the relationships are variable in time, and this is what is critical to understand.

Sustainability is very important and not in the basic or banal sense that is normally given to the question of sustainability, but in the sense of the ability to generate impact in the short, medium and long-term impacts of a different order and to generate an effect.

That is to say to have an agency in the short, medium and long-term. The same is true for landscape architecture as for ephemeral architecture, that is when you are intervening a concrete public space, for example, with an event. It would be the most extreme case since it is very short and almost without physical infrastructure, but you are generating a temporary impact in short scale but you may be generating or trying to generate other medium and long-term impacts.

For example, we are now working in a specific public space near Barcelona that, after studying it very well, we understood that it has no problem beyond having a negative perception. Before it was a central space in which this neighborhood was physically or morphologically generated as a central square. The negative perception comes from issues of urban and sociological development and also from the fact that the people who lived there were considered humble and that it is now a less humble neighborhood.

The citizens have ended up associating this place with a humble origin that they do not like so much. The negative perception also has to do with the migration issue but that really is not a problem there at all. They are trying to make a physical change in the square , to reorganize and urbanize it.

We told them that this is very good but it costs a lot of money and this will improve the square and that by all means we have to do this, but we think it is very important that this physical “re-bumping” costs a few million euros. Preceded not only by a participatory process in the construction site but also by encouraging the appropriation of this square by those of the immediate neighbors and citizens. Generate some kind of action that helps people feel theirs this square, and this can be super basic actions and with a minimal design component, for example, organizing chocolate night once a month.

**JG:** This is what many call Place Making?

**RP:**  we call it Civic Place Making

In this case what we are doing, without having to give too many speeches at a conceptual level of what we are doing at the public level, we say “We invite you to take charge of the Christmas decoration of this square”. We as designers, in this case as planners, to be more precise or as ephemeral architects. What we propose is to generate a basic structure that allows this space to be free but obviously “curated and managed” because otherwise, things do not happen (laughs), but not directed in the classical sense. For what? To achieve an effect in which I can take a photo with others and spend a memorable moment but above all to establish this dynamic of co-creation and active participation. This means not the classical  consultative participation.  They participate actively not only in the design of the square but (and I will use this word voluntarily) the “decoration,” a very modest thing, apparently very banal, with little conceptual charge.

In addition to this we are also proposing “plaça in calcetines” the idea is to domesticate the square, turn it into something domestic. You walk in your house in socks and to the square also in socks. The sock is also a Christmas element and has been customized by children in school and the elderly in their homes. Hanging their own socks that have been personalized next to all the other socks  in the square is telling in a clear way that many people are appropriating this square. And then this is the excuse to make visible the bottom line that is to make people converge again to the square and turn it into a space of sociality.

In this particular case, which is not very large at the level of gestures, what we are trying to do is to achieve on the one hand that in the short timescale there is a visibility, for example in the newspaper, but also to make visible a process and  intention of making a co-creation between some designers and architects with a public administration and with the citizens organized through their neighborhood organizations.
"][p-0o98"

Three things come from this example:

In the short term it is simple and cheap to do

In the medium term, the idea would be that having contributed the specific infrastructure, in this case, very basic exterior lights that are reconfigurable, they are encouraged to use them creatively in the other Christmas no longer with specialists but directly with the people of the neighborhood. We facilitate a little, but ideally, they do it themselves.

In the long term ideally what this would have to allow is to make a place where memories have already been generated, people’s experiences having a good time and sharing space in a humanely productive way not only intellectually but vitally so they feel good in that space therefore they will care for it much more in every way. This is a super simple example, but there are many other very interesting ones.

It seems very interesting to me, and it seems to me that there are other formats in which we can work. The one I just told you could be summarized by saying: Through ephemeral design one can change the perception of a place.

I like many of the examples that you raised, for example, the bridge(Luchtsingel) with co-financing and Partizaning although I do not know them. Similar to Partizaning there is Raum Labor that they were doing with this type of actions in Berlin in the late and early 90’s that are much more direct than our methods.

Another framework of work for me could be: Use temporary architecture as a testing ground for a permanent architecture and be able to use cheaper affordable mechanisms, feasible both economically and at an organizational level as well as at the level of involving citizens than a conventional project.

Thinking of a space that at this moment does not work very well and to propose some logic of temporary intervention that allows to point directions that can get to consolidate in a permanent intervention and this is not a project that begins and ends when the intervention is made, since then one has to be able to record the effect that this intervention is having or will have. For example regarding the flows of the square, or how it is organized or how it is perceived, etc. So to speak, the test field

**JG:** I find interesting what you propose because in my thesis I relate technology and electronics embedded in the public space.
In my thesis, there is a part where I talk about this giving some examples in cities of the United States, where planners propose a great use of data extraction in an unethical way.
It would be interesting in these dynamics of short temporality and civic placemaking to generate a speculative discourse.
That is, to show one of the paths that the conception of these spaces could take. A participatory and speculative mediation.

How ephemeral space can speculatively show what a long-term space would look like?

**RP:**  Changing the perception of public space should have the logic of sustainability and one of the test field. For me, it is not so much the use of temporality as a permanent model, but precisely because of its very nature, temporality allows us a much greater risk and this allows generating a higher field of evidence. It is not so much as you said to educate or to tell a resolution but to pose a significant problem. For example, the issue of surveillance that you are aiming for. In that sense, we are again in a participatory logic of citizenship that is not consultative but is co-creative. For me this is important.

I think it would be a third exciting element to consider what kind of formats can take the ephemeral architecture of temporary design in public space. What variety of formats can be co-created that do not exist directly nowadays? In this case, technology plays a fundamental role, for example outside the Apple Stores in Barcelona there is free WIFI. These spaces have become a meeting place for a type of population that for economic reasons does not have access to broadband and appropriates this space in a rather picturesque way, simply because there is a service that did not exist before. New formats of public space generated from logics of technological services and experiences that use technology can be imagined.
