# 04 Controlled vocabulary: technique and human autocompletion with Pierke I.S. Bosschieter, Caroline Diepeveen

SF&emsp;&emsp;*The elaboration of an index seems to have similarities with the tagging system: from a full text, it extracts some keywords that will act as reference points. Therefore, the process of indexing implies decision making: where to put the emphasis on, where to direct the reader’s eyes. It implies discerning what is relevant and non relevant information. How do you make this selection? What strategies have you developed while going through this process of indexing?*

PB&emsp;&emsp;First of all, there are international rules for indexing and many books about how to index exist. Secondly, it implies software. In the same way Microsoft Word helps you write a text, a program assists you in the elaboration of the index. It combines several functionalities, such as an alphabetical sorting tool that stores the inputs so that words already known can be automatically filled in for the next time. Although it serves as a support, it doesn’t play a role in the seeking process: what to put in the index, and how to put it in. The same way, even if you try to apply the rules, sometimes a book is so peculiar that you have to leave all the rules out to make a good index for this specific book. Also, how often a word is used in the book is an indicator of its importance. When a subject is covered for 2 pages, then it is necessary to pick it up. It is mostly a feeling, and you learn with doing.

CD&emsp;&emsp;It remains difficult to put it into precise terms how you do it, but the term selection is a very human feature. It is not something a computer can do for you, because context does everything. An author once said “you have deconstructed my book, taking it to pieces, and you have reassembled it in a different way”, which I thought was a rather nice way of putting. Thus, we only take the essence, there is nothing extra. As short as possible, as concise as possible. It means that you have to understand what you are reading, or seeing if you do images, so you are specialised in certain subjects. Some texts like philosophical texts are very hard to index, because it is hard to put them into precise terms. I have done sociality for example, but meta-sociality, so sociology about sociality, which becomes very abstract.

SF&emsp;&emsp;*So this task requires to stay as technical as possible, but even by willing to get out of the process and be the most objective as possible, it still requires some intention behind it. An indexer needs to fill in the gaps, to guess which word will be the most expected and intelligible by the largest number of potential readers. When you are dealing with more abstract topics, do you have the freedom to create new terms or can you only use the words that are already in the text? And what are the underlying systems of making these choices? Do you have other criteria?*

CD&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes, it seems especially vague but you have to always comply with the text, you can’t make up things, it has to be there. You can sometimes use a different word, but even then, you have to be careful that it means the same thing, that it doesn’t lead to something different. Sometimes you have very abstract words that you can use, like time, or other, or self. They are very generic and vague terms, but within the text they might be meaningful. I’ve sometimes made a small Thesaurus, a sort of a tree structure, with broader and narrower terms. You start with the broader term and you branch out into the narrower term, also with equivalent terms, so you know where to cross references.


PB&emsp;&emsp;You try to follow the language of the author. But if you want to do more entries into the text, you have to come up with synonyms, and this is applicable to any type of text. For example, the author is talking about the emperor, and you have to find which emperor. It is not always exactly how the author put it in his text, but you try to stay close. This is why there may remain considerable differences between two indexers doing the index for the same book. When somebody asks you to write an article about Brexit. If someone next to you writes an article about Brexit, it will be a completely different article, and I think that’s the same with indexing.
